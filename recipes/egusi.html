    <h4>Nigerian egusi soup</h4>

<p><strong>Egusi soup</strong> is native to West Africa (Nigeria), and many of my American and Nigerian friends have enjoyed it. It is a great soup for those who like to try something different every once in a while. Ground Egusi seeds give this soup a unique color and flavor.</p>

<p>It is an exotic hearty food that will satisfy your taste bud.  It is an uncomplicated one-pot meal that is often accompanied by swallows like Fresh garri (Eba), Amala, Semovita, Pounded yam, Fufu, and the likes</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <li>1 cup blended onions (about 3- 5 and fresh chilies, to taste)</li>
