# odin-recipes
This is my first Odin project 
The project is basically for the purpose of learning how to combine all I have learnt so far in HMTL

These are the following skills I developed after completing the project:
- Writing codes for a basic HTML page
- Adding links
- Adding images
- Basic Git skills such as Git clone, add, commit, log, status, and push.
